# YGC Reports

**Daily report automation for Yemen Gas Company representatives.**

> Built with love by [AmtCode](https://amtcode.com) — because developers shouldn't need a calculator every single day.

## 📖 About the Project

**YGC Reports** is a mobile application I built to make daily station reporting faster, cleaner, and 100% error-free. The idea was born out of frustration: I found myself repeating the same calculations with a calculator, writing reports manually, and wasting time fixing contradictions. As a developer, I decided to automate the entire thing — once and for all.

The result? A sleek, native-feeling Flutter app that produces perfect reports in minutes — with full editing, Arabic/English support, smart validations, and even employer signatures.

And now, it's open-source. 🎉
